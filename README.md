    <h2>Setup Configuration API</h2>
    <div>
      <p>There is a file located in the following path: <code>fitness-cat\api\src\Api</code>
      </p>
      <p>The file is named <code>usersecrets.json.example</code>. </p>
      <p>This file contains sensitive information such as API keys and passwords that should not be included in your source code. Therefore, you will need to insert this file into the API user secrets.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In order to use this API, you will need to set up the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>SendMail:</strong> You will need to obtain an API key and ID from SendMail and replace the placeholders in the configuration file with your own.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mailosaur:</strong> You will need to obtain an ID and API key from Mailosaur and replace the placeholders in the configuration file with your own.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Kestrel:</strong> If you plan on using HTTPS in development, you will need to create a self-signed certificate and replace the certificate password placeholder in the configuration file with your own.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>JWT:</strong> You will need to generate your own secret keys for JWT and replace the placeholders in the configuration file with your own.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Email:</strong> You will need to provide the email address and password of the sender for the email service you plan to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Database:</strong> You will need to provide the connection string to your own database and replace the placeholders in the configuration file with your own.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ReCAPTCHA:</strong> You will need to obtain a project ID and site key from Google reCAPTCHA and replace the placeholders in the configuration file with your own.
      </li>
    </ul>
